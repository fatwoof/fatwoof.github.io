# Introduction
Welcome to the landing page of the Central Texas Disc Golf Community (CTDGC) Discord! We bring together disc golfers of all skill levels across Central Texas to connect, discuss, and share experiences.

### Purpose
Our purpose is to foster a thriving disc golf community where you can meet fellow golfers, engage in insightful conversations, stay updated on news and events, and grow together.

### What's Discord?
Discord is a communication platform that combines text, voice, and video chat for seamless community interactions. It's chosen by disc golf communities for its user-friendly interface, focus on community engagement, and versatile communication options. You can access our community through the Discord mobile app, desktop application, or any web browser.

# Community Features

### Customized Channels
Discord's channel feature allows for organized communication by categorizing discussions into specific topics. Channels are particularly beneficial for larger communities as they provide dedicated areas for focused conversations. In the initial stages, a limited number of channels are intentionally set up to promote simplicity and foster stronger connections. As the need arises for dedicated spaces to discuss specific topics, additional channels can be added to accommodate those needs.
