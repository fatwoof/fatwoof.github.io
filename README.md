# Introduction
Welcome to the landing page of the Central Texas Disc Golf Community (CTDGC)! We bring together disc golfers of all skill levels across Central Texas to connect, discuss, and share experiences.

Our purpose is to foster a thriving disc golf community where you can meet fellow golfers, engage in insightful conversations, stay updated on news and events, and grow together.

### Community Platform
Discord is a communication platform that combines text, voice, and video chat for seamless community interactions. It's chosen by disc golf communities for its user-friendly interface, focus on community engagement, and versatile communication options. You can access our community through the Discord mobile app, desktop application, or any web browser. Discord offers:

1. Distraction-Free Disc Golf Focus: Enjoy a dedicated space for disc golf discussions, free from unrelated content and distractions commonly found on other platforms.
2. Seamless Organization and Event Planning: Utilize dedicated channels to schedule and coordinate disc golf meetups, ensuring efficient organization and hassle-free event planning.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Benefit from Discord's intuitive and immersive interface, designed specifically for community interactions, making it easy to connect and engage with fellow disc golfers.

# Community Features

### Customized Channels
Discord's channel feature allows for organized communication by categorizing discussions into specific topics. Channels are particularly beneficial for larger communities as they provide dedicated areas for focused conversations. In the initial stages, a limited number of channels are set up to promote simplicity and foster stronger connections. As the need arises for dedicated spaces to discuss specific topics, additional channels can be added to accommodate those needs.

### Promote and Discover Disc Golf Events
Discord is a powerful platform for event promotion. Whether you're organizing a tournament, a casual meetup, or a special event, you can share details and engage with the community in real-time. Get the word out, reach a broader audience, and ignite excitement as you showcase your disc golf events.

### Experience Seamless Round Organization
Easily join and invite others to rounds of disc golf, even on short notice. Whether you're planning a spontaneous outing or looking for someone to join you last-minute, Discord's instant communication and notification features enable you to connect with fellow golfers swiftly and efficiently. Don't miss out on exciting rounds and the chance to build new connections within the Central Texas disc golf community â€” just a few clicks and you're ready to hit the course together.

# Word on the street

> This is soo much better than our old group text. Now, when new people join, we don't have to start a whole new message thread.  

> Yes! I can finally delete messages I accidentally send. Thanks for nothing, GroupMe

> Facebook is great and all, but half my friends don't have one for whatever reason. With Discord, I don't have to comporomise my privacy/security to participate in the disc golf community.
